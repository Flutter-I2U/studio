# Studio

**The open-source drag-and-drop UI builder for Flutter**

Studio is a visual UI builder that empowers developers to create Flutter interfaces without compromising on freedom or functionality. Unlike closed platforms that lock you into their ecosystem, limit customization, or put your work behind a paywall, Studio gives you complete control over your Flutter development process.

## ✨ Features

- **🎯 Visual Design**: Build UIs with an intuitive drag-and-drop interface
- **⚡ Full Customization**: Customize every widget, layout, and property to match your vision
- **📦 Clean Code Export**: Generate clean, readable Flutter code that you fully own
- **🔓 No Lock-in**: Export your work anytime - no subscriptions, no vendor lock-in
- **🆓 Forever Free**: Open-source and always will be
- **🚀 Fast Prototyping**: Quickly iterate on designs and ideas
- **🎨 Pixel-Perfect**: Craft detailed layouts with precision controls

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (latest stable version)
- Dart SDK
- Your favorite code editor (VS Code, IntelliJ, etc.)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/studio.git
cd studio
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

3. Run Studio:
```bash
flutter run
```

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Design Visually**: Use the drag-and-drop interface to place and arrange Flutter widgets
2. **Customize Properties**: Fine-tune colors, spacing, fonts, and all widget properties
3. **Preview Live**: See your changes in real-time as you build
4. **Export Code**: Generate clean Flutter code that integrates seamlessly into your projects

### Exporting Code

Studio generates clean, maintainable Flutter code that follows best practices:

- Proper widget hierarchy and structure
- Readable variable names and comments
- Optimized for performance
- Ready to integrate into existing Flutter projects
